NumPy on MXNet
=============

NumPy on MXNet provides a NumPy-like interface with extensions
for deep learning. It contains two modules, ``mxnet.np``, which is similar to
NumPy, and ``mxnet.npx``, which contains extended operators that are useful for deep
learning. 

If this is your first time using NumPy on MXNet, we recommend that you review the following topics in this section:
