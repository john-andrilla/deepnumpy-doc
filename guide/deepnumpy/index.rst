#What is DeepNumPy?
=============

DeepNumPy in MXNet provides a NumPy-like interface with extensions
for deep learning. It contains two modules, ``mxnet.np``, which is similar to
NumPy, and ``mxnet.npx``, which offers extended operators that are useful for deep
learning.

##If this is your first time using DeepNumPy
We recommend that you review the following resources to get started. 
- For a quick overview, see :ref:`deepnumpy_cheat_sheet`.
- If you are familiar with NumPy, check :ref:`deepnumpy_vs_numpy`, which explains
  the the differences between DeepNumPy and NumPy.
- If you have used `mxnet.nd` before, check the tutorial [TODO]
