DeepNumPy
=============

DeepNumPy in MXNet provides a NumPy-like interface with extensions
for deep learning. It contains two modules, ``mxnet.np``. which is similar to
NumPy, and ``mxnet.npx``, which contains extended operators that are useful for deep
learning. If this is your first time using DeepNumPy, we recommend that you review the following resources.

- For a quick overview, see :ref:`deepnumpy_cheat_sheet` 
- If you are familiar with NumPy, see :ref:`deepnumpy_vs_numpy`, which explains
  the the differences
- If you've used `mxnet.nd` before, see the tutorial [TODO]
