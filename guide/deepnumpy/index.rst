DeepNumPy
=============

The DeepNumpy front-end in MXNet provides a NumPy-like interface with extensions
for deep learning. It contains two modules, ``mxnet.np`` that is similar to
NumPy, and ``mxnet.npx`` for extended operators that are useful for deep
learning. To get started,

- check the :ref:`deepnumpy_cheat_sheet` for a quick overview
- if you are familiar with NumPy, check :ref:`deepnumpy_vs_numpy` that explans
  the the differences
- if you used `mxnet.nd` before, check the tutorial [TODO]
